# AIReferences
Finding good references for AI, deep learning and all other computer science topics is, in my experience, far more difficult than finding good references for
physics.  Here I will write my own (clear and understandable) review on these subjects for my own future reference.  I have yet to decide on the scope of this.
Obviously the term "AI" has been hijacked and is now pure marketing/business-speak bullshit, but I suppose it was never clearly defined anyway, so I will use
that increasingly-obnoxious term as a guide to which topics will be discussed.  Of course this will also be driven by practical considerations.

Source code is kept in `src` and can be compiled with `src/compile.sh`.  At some point I'll set up pandoc to make markdown copies so that this is readable
directly off github.
